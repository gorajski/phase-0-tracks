/*"Cascading" in this context means that because more than one stylesheet rule could apply to a particular piece of HTML, there has to be a known way of determining which specific stylesheet rule applies to which piece of HTML.
The rule used is chosen by cascading down from the more general rules to the specific rule required. The most specific rule is chosen.
