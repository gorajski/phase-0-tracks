   <h1> "The Brain Bug" </h1>
    <p> Toxoplasma gondii is a parasite known to reproduce in cats, but can infect many warm-blooded animals.<strong>(1)</strong>  The bacteria is known to <em>invade the brain</em> of its host and can cause <em>behavioral changes</em> to the host that may help it advance to the next stage in its life cycle.  <em>Its effects in humans are currently being studied.</em>
    </p>
    <p>Some evidence <strong>(2)</strong> exists to suggest toxoplasma may influence the development of the following diseases in humans, although this connection has not been definitively proven as of 2016-03-29:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Sudden Rage</li>
     <li>Bipolar Disorder</li>
     <li>Schizophrenia</li>
    </ul>
